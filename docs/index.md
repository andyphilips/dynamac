### Description<a id="description"></a>
While autoregressive distributed lag models allow for extremely fexible dynamics, interpreting substantive significance of complex lag structures remains difficult. This package is designed to assist users in dynamically simulating and plotting the results of various autoregressive distributed lag models. It also contains post-estimation diagnostics, including the Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (2001) test for cointegration when estimating the error-correction variant of the autoregressive distributed lag model.
