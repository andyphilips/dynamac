\title{Estimate and Simulate ARDL Model}
\usage{
dynardl(formula, data = list(), lags = list(), diffs = list(),
  lagdiffs = list(), levels = list(), ec = FALSE, range = 20,
  sig = 95, time = 10, shockvar = list(),
  shockval = sd(data[[shockvar]]), sims = 1000, forceset = NULL,
  burnin = 20, expectedval = FALSE, trend = FALSE, constant = TRUE,
  graph = FALSE, rarea = TRUE, modelout = FALSE, simulate = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{a symbolic description of the model to be estimated. ARDL
models are estimated using linear regression.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame or list containing the the variables in
the model.}

\item{lags}{a list of variables and their corresponding lags to be
estimated.}

\item{diffs}{a list of variables and their corresponding difference to be
differenced. Only first differences are supported.}

\item{lagdiffs}{a list of variables to be included in lagged differences.}

\item{levels}{a list of variables to be included in levels.}

\item{ec}{estimate model in error-correction form, (i.e., \code{y} appears
in first-differences). By default, \code{ec} is set to \code{FALSE},
meaning \code{y} will appear in levels.}

\item{range}{the range of the simulation to be conducted}

\item{sig}{the significance level (1 - \code{p}) that the user wants for
the simulations. The default level is 95\% significance (\code{sig = 95}).}

\item{time}{the time period in the simulation for the variable to be
shocked.}

\item{shockvar}{the variable to be shocked. There is no default.}

\item{shockval}{the amount by which the \code{shockvar} should be shocked.
The default is one standard deviation of the shocked variable.}

\item{sims}{the number of simulations to use in creating the quantities of
interest.}

\item{forceset}{by default, in the simulations, variables in levels will be
set to their means; variables in differences will be set to 0.
Alternatively, users can set any variable in the model to a different value
using a list in \code{forceset}.}

\item{burnin}{the number of time periods to disregard before recording the
values. These do not include the \code{range}; in other words, they take
place before the \code{range} specified above. Users can increase the
number of \code{burnin} periods, but probably should not decrease them.}

\item{expectedval}{if this is \code{TRUE}, the simulation will record the
expected values of across the \code{sims} by averaging errors. We recommend
setting it to \code{FALSE}, since expected values do not account for
stochastic error present in the model itself.}

\item{trend}{include a linear time trend}

\item{constant}{include a constant}

\item{graph}{create a plot of the sumulated response}

\item{rarea}{if \code{graph = TRUE}, create an area plot. If \code{graph =
TRUE} and \code{rarea = FALSE}, a spike plot will be created.}

\item{modelout}{print the regression estimates in the console}

\item{simulate}{simulate the reponse. Otherwise, just the regression model
will be estimated.}
}
\value{
\code{dynardl} should always return an estimated model. It may or
may not be simulated, according to the user. But the relevant regression
output, model residuals (which can be tested for autocorrelation), and
simulated response (if created) are stored in a list if the model is
assigned to an object.

\description{
Estimate autoregressive distributed lag model, simulate interesting values,
and plot predictions
}
\details{
Estimate an auto-regressive distributed lag model. Moreover, provide a
graphical interpretation of the results by simulating the response of 
the dependent variable to shocks in one of the weakly exogenous regressors.
